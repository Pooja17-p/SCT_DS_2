**Task 02: Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)**

📌 **Objective**
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset in order to understand data patterns, relationships, and key factors influencing passenger survival.

🛠 **Tools Used**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📊 **Description**
This task involved conducting comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset to gain insights into passenger demographics and survival outcomes. Multiple visualizations were developed to examine survival rates, age distribution, gender-based survival trends, and correlations among numerical features.

EDA plays a crucial role in understanding dataset structure, identifying trends, detecting relationships, and preparing data for downstream machine learning tasks.

📈 **Visualizations Created**

* Survival count bar chart
* Age distribution histogram
* Gender-based survival comparison
* Correlation heatmap of numerical features

🔍 **Key Observations**

* A higher number of passengers did not survive compared to those who survived.
* Most passengers belonged to the young adult age group.
* Female passengers exhibited significantly higher survival rates than male passengers.
* Passenger class and fare showed strong correlations with survival outcomes.

🎯 **Learning Outcomes**

* Performing structured Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas
* Creating insightful visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Interpreting feature relationships and survival trends
* Understanding data thoroughly before applying machine learning models
